            <p class="text-center">Please take a little time to read the following document. The document is about some<br>guidelines we would like you to follow while using the School Cafeteria.</p>
            <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Meal Schedules</span><br><strong>Monday to Friday</strong><br>Breakfast 7:15-7:55<br>Lunch 12:15-13:00<br>Dinner 18:00-18:40<br>Snack 10:45<br><br><strong>Saturday, Sunday, and School Holidays</strong><br>Breakfast 8:30-9:30<br>Lunch 12:20-13:20<br>Dinner 18:00-18:40<br>Snack 15:00<br><br>Please come on time to every meal and return your trays and dishes before the end of the<br>meal schedule.<br><br>Please keep your School Cafeteria clean for yourself and for the rest of the community. We will<br>provide you towels when needed.<br><br>Wear a Mask and sanitize your hands when you come to the cafeteria.<br><br>When serving yourself, please serve yourself in a balanced way. Please serve yourself<br>vegetables, which are a very important part of your daily nutrition, and not just the main or<br>rice or potatoes.<br><br>When you come back to serve yourself some seconds, or refill your drinks, please wear a mask.<br>During Lunch time you can choose between either the main dish of the day or the noodle of<br>the day or the lunch special (Monday to Friday). You can serve yourself the side dishes with<br>any of these options.<br><br>We prepare Vegetarian and Halal food according to the numbers of Vegetarian and Halal<br>People. If you are not either Vegetarian or Halal, please refrain from asking for these dishes<br>until we can make sure we are going to have enough food to serve all of them.<br><br>If you have any dietary restriction (Food Allergy, Vegetarian, Halal, etc), please be very careful<br>to check the information in the Menu Cards every time. If you are not sure, please ask our<br>staff.<br><br><strong>Please follow the Limit Cards.</strong><br><br><strong>Please throw eggshells in the garbage bin. Also, if you drop plates, cups, cutlery etc. inside the</strong><br><strong>food waste disposing area, please let our staff know. </strong>The food waste collected will go to a<br>composting machine and this machine will break if eggshells, paper, plastic, or anything else<br>besides food waste enters it. Repairing the machine costs the school a big amount of money.<br>Let’s all take care of it!<br><br>The food served during Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner is <strong>ONLY to be eaten inside the cafeteria</strong>.<br>No food can be taken out by students unless it’s requested by a school Faculty or Staff.<br><strong>No Plates, Bowls, Cups and Cutlery can be taken to the houses</strong>. They belong to the cafeteria.<br>Also please don’t use them for other activities such as science experiments, art, etc.<br>Don’t stick chewing gum on anything inside the cafeteria including plates, trays, bowls, table,<br>walls, etc. Please throw in the trash.<br><br>When serving yourself something to drink please use only one cup every meal.<br><br>Please don’t bring personal items (plates, bowls, etc.) to the dishwashing area.<br><br>During weekends and school holidays, we will prepare bentos only for events organized by the<br>school. If any student will need bento for any project or event related to the school, please<br>request the bento through a Faculty or Staff (At least one week ahead) mentioning the event,<br>date, time and any special dietary policy like allergies, halal, etc.<br><br>We have a café shop where we sell home baked snacks and many delicious things. Here you<br>can pay by cash or cashless, using a personal account system where you can charge your<br>account by cash or remotely by PayPal. Every student has his/her own PIN Number. Please<br>feel free to pass by the cafeteria and ask Dario (Cezars Kitchen Manager) for your number.<br>Never share this information with anyone else.<br><br>When planning some event that is related to the cafeteria or any meal please communicate<br>before the 15th of the previous month as the latest (if possible, 2 months ahead) through a<br>school Faculty or Staff.<br><br>There is a communication book where you can give us your feedback. Please use to<br>communicate with us.<br><br>Thank you!<br><br><em>Dario Yasuda</em><br><br><em>Kitchen Manager of Cezars Kitchen UWC ISAK</em></p>
